# Game-Development

### This is a repository for Game Development (CMSC 197) laboratory exercises using Unity.

## Machine Problem 1

**Instructions:**
1. Download and Import Challenge 1 - Starter Files from Unity: Create with Code: https://bit.ly/49lcIkA
2. Follow the instructions in the Create with Code page to “fix” the Plane Flying game.
3. In addition to the fixes, implement the following requirements:
* An accompanying Zip File will contain a sample of the Plane Game. You may use thisas reference for the additional requirements.
* Camera must be positioned behind the plane similar to the driving simulator andshould follow the plane while it flies around. Hint: This does not require coding.
* The Plane should still move at a constant pace, however, we will add changes to themovement controls.
* The Plane should be able to tilt and turn to left or right depending on user input. Youmay use the Horizontal Axis for this.
* Create additional obstacles for the Plane/Player to go through. These should includea moving obstacle and one turning/rotating obstacle. You could also use acombination of both. This is where you should get creative!

## Machine Problem 2

**Instructions:**
1. Using the Assets from Unit 2: Basic Gameplay, create a game that is similar to theattached file Playing_Fetch.zip.
2. Specifications:
* Dog: the player should be able to control the dog with arrow keys or WASD control.Using the left joystick of a controller is also acceptable. The dog should be able tomove up, down, left, and right depending on the input of the user. Rotate the dogaccordingly. Hint: You may use transform.LookAt()
* Farmer: this game object will simply throw a Ball game object in the beginning of theexecution. The direction, distance, and when to throw are at random withminimum and maximum values. The farmer may not throw a Ball if it does not haveit in it’s possession.
* Ball: when the Ball is thrown, the Dog should be able to fetch it. Once caught orfetched, the ball should follow the Dog’s position and the Dog should be able toreturn it to the Farmer. Once returned to the Farmer, it should be thrown again forthe Dog to fetch.
3. You may add your own creative twists to this activity but the main specifications shouldbe followed. Enjoy!

## Machine Problem 3

**Instructions:**
1. Using the Assets from Unit 3: Sound and Effects and Challenge 3: Balloons, Bombs, &Booleans, create a game that is similar to the attached file Machine_Problem_3.zip.
2. Specifications:
* Player:
- Player will use a humanoid (farmer or city worker) sprite
- Player can do the following inputs:
> Jump: Press Spacebar to make the player jump. Utilize Rigidbody Physics.2. Crouch/Slide: Press the Down Arrow Key or S key to make the Player Slide.You may change the size of the collider here or have 2 different collidercomponents which you can turn on or off. Other approaches would also bewelcome.
- There are a bunch of animations that are given along with the sprite. Makesure to select the appropriate animation for each action. You may change, add,or manipulate the animation parameters as well as the animation map toachieve what you want.

* Background and obstacles:
- Background and obstacle must be proceduraly generated. It must seem thatthe background is seamless.
- Obstacles must also be procedurally generated.
- There must be at least 2 types of obstacles. One which the player can jumpover, and one that the player can crouch to avoid.
- Make sure that the player has a “way-out” of every situation. There should beno obstacle that is impossible for the player to avoid or get through.
- Nice to have: background and obstacles have the same theme. i.e (wildernessand tree branches, suburban area and fences, etc)
