# Game-Development

### This is a repository for Game Development (CMSC 197) laboratory exercises using Unity.

## Machine Problem 1

**Instructions:**
1. Download and Import Challenge 1 - Starter Files from Unity: Create with Code:https://bit.ly/49lcIkA
2. Follow the instructions in the Create with Code page to “fix” the Plane Flying game.
3. In addition to the fixes, implement the following requirements:
a) An accompanying Zip File will contain a sample of the Plane Game. You may use thisas reference for the additional requirements.
b) Camera must be positioned behind the plane similar to the driving simulator andshould follow the plane while it flies around. Hint: This does not require coding.
c) The Plane should still move at a constant pace, however, we will add changes to themovement controls.
d) The Plane should be able to tilt and turn to left or right depending on user input. Youmay use the Horizontal Axis for this.
e) Create additional obstacles for the Plane/Player to go through. These should includea moving obstacle and one turning/rotating obstacle. You could also use acombination of both. This is where you should get creative!
